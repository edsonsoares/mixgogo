DOUBTS:

	

	- Why am I calling functions that are not listed in the initEvent() when loading the event page

	- Now that I am separating the logc from the data, should I do everything that I was doing in main.js in index.js(routes).


	Difference between router.get and app.get??

	How can I use two different layouts?


NEXT STEPS:

Dates:

	1) Create a new model with dates only Mongoose
	2) Link the dates with posts having that date
	3) Replace the query for the upcoming page. Instead of calling all sets, call the dates, and then display the content associated with each date.

So I have two objects when creating a new set? One only for the image and other for the other params of the Set Object? Do I need to put the artcover object inside the Set object?
